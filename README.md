* There is a new manâ€™s best friend in modern times: smartphones. People spend more time using their devices than going to the gym, playing sports or meeting their friends and family.
* Currently, the average number of hours that a human being spend using their phone is 5.5 hours a day, but I bet your average is much higher. Do you agree?! Conventional means of work and relationships have been replaced by how much itâ€™s easier to be on our cellphones, people work on their cellphones, keep in touch with friends and relatives, have fun through them, watch movies, listen to music, no matter what you want to do, your phone is always the best option to get what you want.
