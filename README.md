# Phone2earn

* In modern times there is a new best friend of man, the smartphone, people spend more time using their device than going to the gym, playing sports, meeting their family or friends.
* The average number of hours that humans currently spend using their cell phone is 5.5 hours a day, but I bet your average is much higher. Do you agree?! Conventional means of work and relationships have been replaced by the practicality of the smartphone, people work on their cell phones, relate to each other on their cell phones, have fun through them, watch movies, listen to music, no matter what you want to do, the cell phone is always the best option for you to have what you want.
